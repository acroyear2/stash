# stash

get/set local storage entities with persistent references.

##Â usage

```js
var kind = stash.Kind('butterflies', { max_refs: 2 });

var entity = stash.Entity(kind, 'swallowtail', 
  { family: 'papillion', wings: 2 })
  .add_reference('spicebush')
  .add_reference('lime')
  .save();

// later on... browsers are closed, things happened
stash.get('butterflies', 'lime'); // yayy
```

## api

Exposes `Kind`, `Entity` and `get`.

### get(kind, ref_key)

Given a `Kind` object and a reference key, this will construct and return an `Entity` instance if it is available on local storage.

`kind` should be of type `Kind` preferably, if you pass a string instead it will be cast into a `Kind` with default options.

### Kind(name, opts)

`opts` object currently accepts only `max_refs` defined which is the maximum number of allowed references of an `Entity` of this particular `Kind`. (default `max_refs`: 3)

### Entity(kind, key, val)

An `Entity` will be persisted into local storage upon a `save` along with its refs.

If `max_refs` is reached, this will act like a lifo queue and remove old references.

Note that `Entity` methods are chainable.

### .add_reference(key)

### .save()
